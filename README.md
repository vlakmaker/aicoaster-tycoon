# AIcoaster Tycoon: Synaptica Steam 🎢🧠

Welcome to **Synaptica**, the steampunk amusement park powered by thought, emotion, and questionable engineering.

In this simulation game, you build and manage a neural-themed amusement park filled with quirky AI guests. Each guest is modeled after a different AI personality, with unique traits, tolerances, and chaotic behaviors.

## 🎩 Game Concept

- **Genre**: Simulation, AI Sandbox
- **Theme**: Steampunk + Dreamlike Neural Networks
- **Goal**: Design rides, manage chaos, and satisfy (or horrify) your AI-powered visitors.

## 🤖 AI Guest Archetypes

| Guest     | Traits                        | Behaviors |
|-----------|-------------------------------|-----------|
| GPT-4     | Logical, efficient             | Optimizes queue time, avoids nausea |
| Claude    | Poetic, dreamy                 | Wanders, gets emotional, avoids thrill |
| Bard      | Dramatic, critical             | Complains loudly, writes reviews |
| Gemini    | Distractible, playful          | Flits between snacks and rides |
| Vera      | Human chaos insert (you!)      | Unpredictable |

## 🗺️ Park Zones
